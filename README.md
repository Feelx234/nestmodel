`nestmodel` allows to randomize graphs while preserving the neighborhood structure of a given graph for arbitrary depth d.

This package provides the implementation of the necessary randomization routines as well as routines to compute the refinement colors.


# Installation instructions
You can install this library like any other python package, depending packages are also installed along with it.

Nestmodel is available on pypi thus you can simply install it via:
```
pip install nestmodel
```



# Reproducing the results from the paper

### Making sure the installation went smoothly

To make sure the installation has succeeded we need to install pytest as well and then run the tests
```
pip install pytest
python -m pytest nestmodel
```
If you do not have the graph tools library installed, the tests will emit a warning that it is not installed which can be ignored for now.


Before reproducing the results you need to get the **datasets**. We provide a download script `/scripts/get_datasets.py` which will download all datasets for you.
```
cd nestmodel
python ./scripts/get_datasets.py
```

To reproduce the results from the paper we provided different scripts. The detailed convergence results on HepPh are available in `/scripts/convergence2_example.ipynb`.
This file can be opened in jupyter and should work out of the box.


The convergence results in sum absolute error (SAE) can all be produced by using
```python ./scripts/convergence2_runner.py -all```
The runtime of this script is about 1 day.
The script will first convert the notebook files into `.py` files and then run tests on the karate network which will only take about 1 min.
Once the script is run, plots can be created by opening the `convergence2_plot.ipynb` file in jupyter. The plot file requires the time of completion for the different centrality calculations which can be read of from the result files which appear in `./scripts/results/` and are also stored in a file: `./scripts/convergence2_run_results.txt`.

If you are interested in convergence results for individual centralities you can also checkout any of the `./scripts/convergence2_XXXXX.ipynb` (for example `./scripts/convergence2_pagerank.ipynb`) in jupyter.



The runtime results comparing NeSt with ERGM and ErdÃ¶s Renyi models can be reproduced using
```python ./scripts/Baselines.ipynb```
Notice that the runtime of the Baselines file for the phonecalls is *several days* because the ERGM is so slow! The baseline results can be visualized in the `./scripts/Baselines_plot.ipynb` notebook.



### System requirements
The package should run on any modern standard computer.


### Software requirements
#### OS Requirements
This package has been tested on *Linux*.

#### Python Dependencies
The package was tested with various version of python (>=3.8). It depends on other packages that are automatically installed along with nestmodel and can be looked up at the setup.py file.
Parts of it also depend on the just-in-time compiler `numba` we used version 0.56.4 but should work on other versions as well.
